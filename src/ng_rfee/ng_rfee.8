NAME

ng_rfee -- a dynamically programmable switch matrix


DESCRIPTION

ng_rfee is a dynamically programmable switch matrix netgraph node with
embedded traffic shaping capabilities, aimed primarily at supporting
emulation of MANET environments.

A fundamental identifier of objects connected to ng_rfee hooks is a
small integer number called endpoint identifier (EPID).  EPIDs typically
correspond to virtual nodes in a MANET experiment running on top of
ng_rfee switching matrix, and must be unique.


HOOKS

This node type currently supports a single hook type:

    linkNNN
	Transmits and receives raw frames, typically to and from locally
	connected ng_eiface nodes assigned to virtual nodes.  Each frame
	received on a link hook will be delivered to other link hooks in
	accordance with the distribution list configured on the inbound link
	hook.  In practice, the distribution list may range from being void,
	i.e. resulting in all received frames being silently discarded,
	or contain up to MAX_LINK_EPIDS (currently 2048) individual EPIDs
	associated with hooks to each of which an identical copy of the
	received frame will be delivered.  Link hooks can be configured
	to enforce transmit bandwidth emulation, inter-frame delays with
	random jitter, and probabilistic retransmission of frames.  Moreover,
	independent propagation delays and bit error rates can be associated
	with each individual EPID included in the distribution list.
	Propagation delays and probabilistic packet discards based on BER
	are enforced on outbound link hooks.  The configuration of link hooks,
	in particular the list of destination EPIDs and associated propagation
	delays and BERs, may be changed dynamically at any point in time.


CONTROL MESSAGES

This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:

        NGM_RFEE_SETLINKCFG, NGM_RFEE_GETLINKCFG

The internal link configuration message format is still subject to change.
Therefore, currently the recommended method for configuring ng_rfee nodes
is using ASCII form messages (see below).


ASCII FORM CONTROL MESSAGES

This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:
	
	setlinkcfg, getlinkcfg


SHUTDOWN

This node disconnects all link hooks and shuts down upon receipt of a
NGM_SHUTDOWN control message.


EXAMPLES

# Create two local virtual nodes
jail -c name=n100 vnet persist
jail -c name=n101 vnet persist
jexec n100 ifconfig lo0 localhost
jexec n101 ifconfig lo0 localhost

# Create & configure two ng_eiface nodes and assign them to jails
ngctl mkpeer eiface ether ether
ngctl mkpeer eiface ether ether
ifconfig ngeth0 ether 2:0:0:0:0:0
ifconfig ngeth1 ether 2:0:0:0:0:1
ifconfig ngeth0 vnet n100
ifconfig ngeth1 vnet n101
jexec n100 ifconfig ngeth0 name eth0
jexec n101 ifconfig ngeth1 name eth0
jexec n100 ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.101/24
jexec n101 ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.102/24

# Create a ng_rfee node
ngctl mkpeer rfee link0 link0

# Connect ng_eiface nodes to ng_rfee node
ngctl connect rfee: ngeth0: link0 ether
ngctl connect rfee: ngeth1: link1 ether

# Per node TX params: local EPID (mandatory), bw, qlen, jitter, dup
# Per destination params: target EPID (mandatory), delay, per, ber

# Configure an asymettric path between virtual nodes n100 and n101
# n100 resides on hook link0:
#	- always transmits at 54 MBps
#	- transmit queue limited to 20 packets
#	- avgerage TX inter-frame delay is 1.5 ms
#	- 4% of all packets are retransmitted
# n101 resides on hook link1:
#	- infinite transmit bandwidth
#	- no TX interframe delays
#	- no packet retransmissions
# n100 -> n101 path properties:
#	- delay 0.5 ms
#	- BER 2E-6 
# n101 -> n100 path properties:
#	- no delay
#	- no BER
ngctl msg rfee: setlinkcfg link0 100:jit1.5:dup4:bw54000000:qlen20 101:ber2E-6:dly0.5
ngctl msg rfee: setlinkcfg link1 101 100
